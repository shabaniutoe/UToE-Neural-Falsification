# UToE 2.1 — Neural Falsification Study

This repository contains code, analysis pipelines, and manuscript sources
for an adversarial empirical test of multiplicative versus additive neural
integration dynamics.

The canonical scholarly archive for this work is hosted on the
Open Science Framework (OSF).

This study performs a preregistered adversarial comparison between:
- multiplicative interaction models
- canonical additive drift models

using human fMRI data, with explicit falsification criteria.

## Scientific Position

This project **does not assume universality**.

Results demonstrate:
- failure of strong universality claims
- partial structural necessity in associative neural systems

This constraint-based outcome is treated as a *successful falsification*,
not a weakness.
